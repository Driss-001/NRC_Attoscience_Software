# NRC_Project

repo to control the devellopment of the analog to didital interface module using  the KS0413 keyestudio ESP32 Core Board , [Board wiki](https://wiki.keyestudio.com/KS0413_keyestudio_ESP32_Core_Board) ,[PinOut references](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/platforms/espressif32.html#pinout-diagram)

 ## Basic Concepts

 Python3 will be used to interact with the board on which a simple program in C/C++  that will mimic dummy analog data that would be generated by a real attophysics experiment, the data will then be processed and presented in a particular selected format.
 The ESP32 microcontroller program will be uploaded using plarformio 

 ## Description of the Experiment
High Harmonic Generation will be observed using 3 photodiodes.
The first  one will record the incoming laser impulse energy, the second will measure the beam diverted by the beam splitter.


## Demo Output
