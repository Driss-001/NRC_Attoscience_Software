# NRC_Project

repo to control the devellopment of the analog to didital interface module using  the KS0413 keyestudio ESP32 Core Board , [Board wiki](https://wiki.keyestudio.com/KS0413_keyestudio_ESP32_Core_Board#Resources_Download)

 ## Basic Concepts

 Python3 will be used to interact with the board on which a simple progrm in arduino C will mimic dummy analog data that would be generated by a real attophysics experiment, the data will then be processed and presented in a particular selected format.
